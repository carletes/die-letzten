Print errors
------------
A few print errors have been corrected -- see the Transcriber's Notes in
the text for the details.

The text contains several nested quotations with the following structure:

    "Hab' Mut, Harald! Du bust ungerecht. Denk! Einmal hast Du gesagt,
    woertlich: "Ich moechte [..]"

I have not added the missing quotation mark at the end of the sentence.


Text versions
-------------
I have produced both Latin-1 and UTF-versions. The UTF-version as
German-style quotation marks. Unitame handles the UTF-version just fine,
apart from transforming German-style quotes to English-style.
